This blog updates irregularly about the electronic work and the scenery photos to improve the writing power of ha2zakura. 
Since it is written as a memorandum for myself, there are many difficult-to-understand contents.
I would be grateful if you could get some ideas from my posts.

Since I'm writing in Japanese, Google Translate should help read entries. 
However, I will answer English (or German) questions. Contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TsL_26).
